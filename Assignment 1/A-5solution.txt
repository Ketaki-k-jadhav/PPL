1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
            suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
            have a suffix `(D)'?

Answer: In given case the variable c has suffix 'D' beacuse in that block,
        c variable is used without any declaration in that conditional.


Question 2.  Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
            to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
            have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
            statements?

    Answer: the syntax for PHI statement is<x_1,x_2,...,x-n> where x is name(bb) in which,
            name is the name of variable and bb is the block number from which the variable
            could be. This block number is according to the initial condition from where
            flow control is decided.


Question 3. Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
            versions of a variable?

    Answer: this could be from nested if-else blocks or in case of switch statements.
