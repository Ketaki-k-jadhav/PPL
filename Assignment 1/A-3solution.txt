A-3:

Question 1. Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?

    Answer: bb3 and bb4 corresponds to while loop. In case of a while loop,
            the condition of while loop is written in if-else form and it checks 
            for the condtion in if part and until it is true, the code in while
            block get executed and when the while condition becomes false,else part get
            executed. 



Question 2.Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?

    Answer: bb5 = intialisation of outer loop variable
            bb10 = checks condition for outer loop
            bb6 = if bb10 is true then intialisation of inner loop variable
            bb8= checks conidition of inner loop
            bb7 = carries out the operations inside the inner for loop and
                    increments inner loop variable
            bb9 = increments outer loop variable
