Question 1.  How is array declaration and initialization handled?

    Answer: Array declaration takes place in a new line with the array length.
           The each elememts of an array are declared on a single line . 

        2   Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
            an intermediate temporary?
    
    Answer: As in GIMPLE one single operation is performed at a time, so
        a[i] and b[i] are first assigned to a temporary variable each and these
        temporary variables are used for furthur operations.

Question 3. Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?
