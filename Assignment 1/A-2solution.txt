Question 1. How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
            differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?

        Answer: If blocks are translated into goto statements and according
                to the conditions those goto blocks get executed.
                In case of conditional looping, the loop continues indefinitely
                until the logical condition is true. 
                In case of unconditional looping the number of iteratons or 
                or repititons are already known in advance and loop is executed 
                according to it or in some case infinitely.

Questions 2.Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
            that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
            representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
            the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
            looking at the CFG dump.
