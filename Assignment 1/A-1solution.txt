A-1 :
Question 1. How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
             happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?
    Answer : In GIMPLE,intially, all the variables are declared,one at a new line 
            each,and then assignment of the values to declared variables is done.
            That is,all the variables are declared at first,each variable declaration
            takes place at a new line and then values are assigned to them.
            In case of a global variable,it is not declared with other variables.
            But for using it inside an operation,the value of global variable is 
            assigned to a temporary variable and that temporary variable is used
            to perform that operation.

            

Question 2. How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
            Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
            introduced?
    Answer : In case of complex expressions, the operation containing already declared
            variables(a and b) is carried out and this intermediate result is stored 
            inside a temporary variable. Remaining part of operation involving constants
            (in this case 25) is carried out using this temporary variable and the final 
            result is stored in an already declared variable(in this case c).


Questions 3. How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
            float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?
    Answer : The floats or doubles are represented with a number contaning only a single
            digit before the decimal point and remaining digits after the decimal point 
            multiplied by power raised to 10.
            Only the integer part(value before the decimal point) of a float/double value
            is assigned to an integer by losing the digits after the decimal point.

Question 4. How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
            there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
            for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?

    Answer: For the statement [Z = Z  + 1], the global variable Z is directly used in an operation,
        for this a temporary variable is used to store the value of global variable and then the
        remaining operation is carried out using the temporary variable and finally the result is again stored
        inside the global variable.
        For the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p], the variables p and q are already declared and assigned
        to the global variable and hence temporary variable is not required
