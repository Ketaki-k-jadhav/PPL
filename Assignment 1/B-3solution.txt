1   In the file B-3.c, what values  can variable `a' take? Will the `if'
            condition [a  < 4] ever  be true?  Inspect the file  B-3.c.*.vrp1 to
            analyze the dump.

    Answer: The variable 'a' can take the values from 4 to 99. The if condition
            will never be true as a is assigned the value between 4 to 99.
            As if condition can never be true, the code in the basic blocks gets
            eliminated .
